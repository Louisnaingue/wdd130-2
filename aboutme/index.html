    <h2>Louis</h2>
    <p> I'm Louis Melch Joshua V. Naingue, but I prefer to be called Louis. 
        I'm a passionate hardworking person but I make time for adventures. 
        Im quite competitive in a good way. I love making new friends. </p>
    <p> I took Applied Technology because I want to develop my own programs 
        and even my own applications that would be beneficial to everyone. 
        I'm a fan of technology, and I've always wanted to learn how it works.
        It feels like magic that can make the impossible possible. Nowadays, 
        everything can be done and accessed easily through technology, and 
        I want to be part of it. </p>
    <p> BYU-Idaho offered an opportunity to learn and earn a bachelor's degree 
        thru online classes that other universities couldn't. I love BYU-Idaho 
        because I can do now what I've always longing to do. </p>
